            <p>
                My name is Chantel Mokwena, and I have had the privilege of working at Adonai Security 
                Services for the past eight months. During my time there, I played a crucial role in assisting the 
                company with building a website, designing software, and troubleshooting any issues that 
                arose. I also took great care in documenting the code, ensuring that the work was well
                organized and maintainable. Throughout my experience, I have developed a strong set of skills that I believe will be valuable 
                in the IT space. I am an excellent problem-solver, a skilled communicator, and a dedicated team 
                player. I follow directions with precision and work exceptionally well under pressure, which has 
                allowed me to excel in the coding process, which I find incredibly intriguing.
